Plugin providing all functions needed to make Enfold Theme 100% compatible with GeoDirectory

== Description ==

With [GeoDirectory plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory) and the compatibility pack you can Turn your Enfold powered website into an interactive Business Directory!

Given the high number of requests for 100% compatibility with this theme layout, we decided to pack the necessary functions and css hacks in a simple plugin.

The plugin does a very simple thing. Through action hooks and filters, it removes the default html wrappers from GeoDirectory templates and adds Enfold html wrappers. 

This make GeoDirectory pages display gracefully when used with Enfold.
